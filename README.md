This project contains a Password Strength Assessment Tool, implemented in Python, that evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords based on criteria such as length (minimum of 8 characters), inclusion of both uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The tool provides real-time feedback to help users improve password security, giving specific suggestions when certain criteria are not met. It also rates the password strength as "Weak," "Moderate," "Strong," or "Very Strong." To run the tool locally, simply execute the `password_strength_checker.py` script using Python in your terminal or preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code). Ensure Python is installed and properly configured in your development environment.
